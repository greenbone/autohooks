[Unrelased]: https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/compare/v2.1.0...master

## [2.1.0] - 2020-04-09

### Added

* Added tools for version handling in autohooks [#51](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/51)
* Added static `get_width` method to Terminal class [#53](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/53)

### Changed

* Reworked `Terminal` class from `terminal.py` [#45](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/45)
* Replaced pipenv with poetry for dependency management. `poetry install` works a
  bit different than `pipenv install`. It installs dev packages and also autohooks
  in editable mode by default. [#51](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/51)
* Activation of the git hooks must be done manually with `autohooks activate`
  always. Using source distributions and a setuptools extension to activate the
  hooks isn't reliable at all [#52](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/52)
* Recommend the `poetry` mode instead of the `pipenv` mode. poetry is more
  reliable than pipenv [#55](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/55)

### Fixed

* Windows Support, by exchanging the unmaintained `blessing` module through
  [`colorful`](https://github.com/timofurrer/colorful)
  [#45](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/45)
* Fixed running `autohooks check` if no `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file exists
  [#49](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/49)

### Removed

* Removed code relying on setuptools and switched to a full poetry build
  process [#54](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/54)

[2.1.0]: https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0

## [2.0.0] - 2019-11-20

### Added

* Introduction of autohooks modes. Modes configure how to handle loading
  autohooks, plugins and dependencies when running the git hook. The
  `pythonpath` mode requires to put the necessary python packages into the
  **PYTHONPATH** manually. The `pipenv` mode uses pipenv to handle the
  dependencies. Using the `pipenv` mode is recommended.
  [#24](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/24)
* Add `poetry` mode to run autohooks via [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)
  [#29](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/29)
* Added type hints/annotations to all methods [#32](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/32)
* Added version meta information to installed pre commit hook
  [#30](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/30)
* Extended autohooks check cli to evaluate current hook version and used mode
  [#30](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/30)
* Enhanced autohooks activate cli to show additional information if a autohooks
  git hook is already installed
  [#30](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/30)
* Added plugin API for additional info status output
  [#39](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/39)
* Added plugin API for additional message printing
  [#39](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/39)

### Changed

* The installed git hook will fail now if autohooks can't be loaded. Before the
  git hook raised only a warning and was ignored. This a major change compared
  to the previous versions. To update existing installations it requires
  overriding the installed git hook by running `autohooks activate --force`.
  [#24](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/24)
* The installed git hook will fail now if a autohooks plugin can't be executed
  e.g. if the import fails. Before these errors were ignored.
  [#28](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/28)
* The version of the installed git hook is checked during its execution
  [#30](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/30)
* A warning is raised during git hook execution if the current mode is different
  to the configured mode [#30](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/30)
* Improved output formatting [#39](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/39)

  **precommit** plugin function. It can be used to receive plugin specific
  settings [#7](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/7)
* Improved check cli to verify settings and specified plugins
  [#12](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/pull/12)
