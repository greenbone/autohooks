Library for managing and writing [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)
in Python using `pyproject.toml` for its settings.

Looking for automatic formatting and linting, e.g., with [black] and [pylint],
while creating a git commit using a pure Python implementation? Do you just want
to have your git hook settings in the `pyproject.toml` file too?

Welcome to **autohooks**!

## Why?

Several outstanding libraries for managing and executing git hooks exist already.
To name a few: [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky),
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged),
[precise-commits](https://github.com/nrwl/precise-commits) or
[pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).

However, they need another interpreter besides python (like husky), require a
different config file besides `pyproject.toml` or are too ambiguous (like
pre-commit). pre-commit is written in python but has support hooks written in
all kind of languages. Additionally, it maintains the dependencies by itself and
does not install them in the current environment.

## Solution

autohooks is a pure python library that installs a minimal
[executable git hook](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks/blob/main/autohooks/precommit/template).
It allows the decision of how to maintain the hook dependencies
by supporting different modes and stores its settings in the well known
`pyproject.toml` file.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ is required for autohooks.

## Plugins

* Python code formatting via [black](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-black)

* Python code formatting via [autopep8](https://github.com/LeoIV/autohooks-plugin-autopep8)

* Python code linting via [pylint](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-pylint)

* Python code linting via [flake8](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-flake8)

* Python code linting via [ruff](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-ruff)

* Python code linting via [mypy](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-mypy)

* Python import sorting via [isort](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-isort)

* Running tests via [pytest](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks-plugin-pytest/)

## Installing autohooks

Quick installation of [pylint] and [black] plugins using [poetry]:

```shell
poetry add --dev autohooks autohooks-plugin-black autohooks-plugin-pylint
poetry run autohooks activate --mode poetry
poetry run autohooks plugins add autohooks.plugins.black autohooks.plugins.pylint
```

The output of `autohooks activate` should be similar to
```
 âœ“ autohooks pre-commit hook installed at /autohooks-test/.git/hooks/pre-commit using poetry mode.
```

Autohooks has an extensible plugin model. Each plugin provides different
functionality which often requires to install additional dependencies.

For managing these dependencies currently three modes are supported by
autohooks:

* `pythonpath` for dependency management via [pip]
* `poetry` for dependency management via [poetry] (recommended)
* `pipenv` for dependency management via [pipenv]

These modes handle how autohooks, the plugins and their dependencies are loaded
during git hook execution.

If no mode is specified in the [`pyproject.toml` config file](#configure-mode-and-plugins-to-be-run)
and no mode is set during [activation](#activating-the-git-hooks), autohooks
will use the [pythonpath mode](#pythonpath-mode) by default.

For more details on using [pip], [poetry] or [pipenv] in conjunction with these
modes see the [documentation](https://greenbone.github.io/autohooks).
